## Overview

This is a custom-designed water bottle to enhance solar water disinfection, a process where people utilize the sun's UV rays to kill bacteria in contaminated water, especially in places without access to clean water. The goal of this project is to design an efficient device that NGOs can buy and distribute to crisis areas around the world. The three stages are fiber membrane filtration, SODIS enhancement via clearer plastic materials, reflection, and heat-trapping, and indication/readiness tracking.
